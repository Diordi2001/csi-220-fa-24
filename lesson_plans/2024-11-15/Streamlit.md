# A Fun Palette-Cleanser for a Friday in Mid-November

Streamlit is a library that allows you to create dashboards that allow others to interact with a dataset through a user-friendly interface.
Today, I'll show you some streamlit dashboards I have made for myself, and then get you started making your own web app/data dashboard. 

## Instructions

Since you all have Github accounts, I want you to do the following

1. Log on to Github.
2. Go to [https://github.com/dataprofessor/streamlit-codespaces-template] and select Fork -> Create a new fork.
3. When you have your fork, I want you to go to your Github project page for the streamlit-codespaces-template and click the `Code` button, then navigate to the `Codespaces` tab, then hit the plus button to create a new codespace.
4. Within the app.py file, work your way through the activities in the (30 Days of Streamlit)[https://blog.streamlit.io/30-days-of-streamlit/] app.
   * In particular, I want you to start at `Day 3`, then work through `Day 5`. Once here, work sequentially through `Day 8`, `Day 9`, etc.
5. Think about a dashboard that would be valuable in your life or to an organization you are involved with (athletics, SGA, friend group, etc.). Make it for a portfolio entry!
