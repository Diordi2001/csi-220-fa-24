- Happy last week of class to you!
- Happy birthday to me!
- Today, we'll work to understand and implement cross validation using a python adaptation of p. 190-194 of "Introduction to Statistical Learning
    with Applications in R" by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. Written by R. Jordan Crouser at Smith College for SDS293: Machine Learning (Spring 2016)"
