It's Fat Bear Week next week! In honor of Fat Bear Week, let's figure out which of my bear-like Pokemon is largest relative to its size. 

Some more background: 
* Pokemon Go recently added a minigame called showcases. In showcases, people enter Pokemon to a contest, and they are 
scored based on their weight, height and their individual values (IVs). The (simplified for this lesson) score assigned to the Pokemon is 
$$\text{Score} = 800 \times \text{StandardizedHeight} + 150 \times \text{StandardizedWeight} + 50 \times \text{NormalizedIVs}$$
  * IVs refer to the sum of the attack, defense, and hp of a Pokemon. Pokemon attack, defense and hp are random numbers between 0 and 15.
So, if the attack is 5, the defense is 7, and the hp is 15, then the total IVs are 27. The normalized IVs of this Pokemon would be 27/45 = 0.6.
    * We could also normalize attack, defense, and hp, then average the result to get the same value. In the example above, normalized attack is 5/15 = 0.3333,
normalized defense is 7/15= .4666, and normalized hp is 15/15=1. The average of .3333, .4666, and 1 is 0.6.
    * To get the normalized IVs, I want you to normalize the attack, defense and hp columns *first* using the techniques from the book. Then create a new column which is `NomalizedIVs` which is the mean
of the normalized stats.
  * I 

1. Download the Fat_Bear.xlsx and Pokemeans.xlsx files from Canvas (Files -> Data Sets -> October 4).
3. Import both files as `pandas` DataFrames.
4. Make a DataFrame that consists only of columns that will help you answer the question "which bear is the
